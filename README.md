## Playing the Game

To start, click on a card. A timer will begin and will be displayed in the heading above the gameboard.  
The card's face will be displayed until you click on another card. If the cards match they will remain open, 
if they don't match they will be flipped face down after a short pause. The game ends when all of the cards
are matched. At the end of the game your star rating and elapsed time will be displayed in a modal. The modal
will ask if you would like to play again.  If you click 'yes' the cards will be reshuffled and the timer and
star rating will be reset. You can click the `restart` button at anytime to restart the game.
